# FastAPI_ML_Model
This project demonstrates a full-stack setup for deploying a Machine Learning model using FastAPI as the backend API and Streamlit as the interactive frontend interface. It provides an end-to-end pipeline — from model serving to real-time user interaction through a simple web app.
